## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (preferably using Bun runtime)
- npm / bun
- Commercetools API credentials

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/amornpic/commercetools-logs-dashboard.git
   cd commercetools-logs-dashboard
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   bun install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the required Commercetools API credentials.
   ```env
    CT_API_URL=your_api_url
    CT_REGION=your_region
    CT_PROJECT_KEYS=your_project_key_dev,your_project_key_uat
    CT_CLIENT_IDS=your_client_id,your_client_id
    CT_CLIENT_SECRETS=your_client_secret,your_client_secret
    CT_SCOPES=your_scopes
   ```
   
   Note: You can specify multiple project keys in the `CT_PROJECT_KEYS` variable by separating them with commas. This allows you to switch between different environments (e.g., development and UAT) using the environment switcher in the application.
4. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   bun run dev
   ```

## Usage
- Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
